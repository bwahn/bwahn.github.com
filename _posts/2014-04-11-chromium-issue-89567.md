title: HTTP Download stops at 2GB when saving the file on another NTFS drive
---

# 이슈 내용들..

```
Chrome Version       : 16.0.912.77 (Mac Mountain Lion)
URLs (if applicable) : various
Other browsers tested: Non

What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. try to download a file greater than 2.15GB
2. Chrome Downloads show the expected size as 2.5, 2.6, 3.2 etc.
3.

What is the expected result?
The download is shown as complete.


What happens instead?
The download is shown in Finder as just 2.15 EVERY time I try to download bigger file.
When playing the mpg4 file the video and sound stop but the tile code keeps running and there is NOTHING I can do to see or hear the missing last section.

```

This bug was reported on Jul 17, 2011 and is not fixed yet... How is that possible? :-(

Can't you reproduce the issue?

Maybe we are talking about different things. I CAN download files bigger than 2GB by a normal HTTP download.
The problem happens when I try to download a file bigger than 2GB in background, which is stored into "$HOME/.config/chromium/Default/File System/001/t/00/" directory, and, when the download finishes the window who asks you about "where to place the download" appears, and moves the temp file from that directory to the directory you choose. Of course, the download never finishes because it's stopped at 2GB, and the "where to place the download" window never appears.

Have you tried to reproduce the issue in that manner?

rdsmith: My current theory of what's going on is as follows:
- This could happen if Chrome has a sparse cache entry for the resource.
- HttpCacheTransaction issues a request for the range (cached_offset ... cached_offset + (2^31 - 1)) (see https://code.google.com/p/chromium/codesearch#chromium/src/net/http/partial_data.cc&l=472)
- Once we start receiving a response, RDH attaches the DownloadResourceHandler to the ResourceHandler chain.
- DownloadResourceHandler calls StopCaching().
- Because the request is not being cached, HttpCacheTransaction doesn't issue a request for the next range. Effectively terminating the download prematurely.
```
